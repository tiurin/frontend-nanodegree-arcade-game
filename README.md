A character appears on the one of the bottom fields of grass.

To win the game you have to reach water line by crossing 3 lines of the road. There are enemies (bugs) moving on the road from left to right, with variable speed. You should avoid collision with them.

If a player's character collides with a bug the game is lost. Grass and water are safe zones, no bugs appear there.

After winning or loosing the game starts from the beginning.

- To add an enemy press `m` (m for more)
- To remove an enemy press `l` (l for less)
